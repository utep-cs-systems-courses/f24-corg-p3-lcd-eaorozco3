This project was inspired from the arcade game "Space Invaders", released
in 1978. Though not as complex, the gameplay is similar. The code itself also
used features and ideas shown in the wakedemo directory.

How it works?
The player controls a magenta spaceship right above a border containing the
current player score near the bottom of the display.
The player can move the spaceship to the left with S1
(button 1) or move to the right with S4 (button 4). Pressing multiple buttons
at once will do all individual functionalities. An alien spawns at the top
left corner of the screen and will move to the right. If uninterrupted, it
will return to the starting upper left corner. The goal of the game is to
shoot the alien with lasers. The player can shoot lasers from their spaceship
by pressing S2 (button 2). If the laser makes contact with the alien, their
score wll update and the alien will reappear after a second elapses. The alien
will reappear and it's speed will increase. There are only four alien speeds
available, 1 being the slowest and 4 being the fastest.
